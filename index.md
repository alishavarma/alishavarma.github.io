## About My Project

The research project centers around measuring creativity. We intend to look into the relationship between creativity and insight generation during the exploratory visual analysis process. During this project, we will be conducting an experimental study to look at analysts' creatvity measures and insight generation process while interacting with various visualization tools. The goals of the project are to conduct an IRB approved experimental study with both video platform and crowdsourced participants, and analyze the results relating to creativity and insight to see if there is a correlation. The process will inovlve generating the IRB paperwork, creating the experiment platform, piloting the experiments, running both versions of the experiment, and analyzing the data. Weekly goals involve reading a couple of related journal/conference articles, a literature search, and weekly writing iterations on the different parts of an article draft.
