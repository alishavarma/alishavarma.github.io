title: Week 7

This week I finished the revisions for the IRB, and it was approved by mid-week! We changed up the experiment protocol up a bit again in terms of administering the creativity pre- and post- task surveys. We decided to increase the time limit to 3 minutes and people being able to list a total of five words that they associate with that shape or color. We also played around with the idea of having people list as many words as possible, however we realized the analysis associated with that would be extremely messy and possibly affect what we are directly measuring for, so we opted for more control. Another struggle during the week was trying to figure out a way to analyze the creativity surveys and how to account for words that were not already mentioned in our association list and if the participant did not list five words. I also began reading the Using Metrics of Curation to Evaluate Information-Based Ideation by Kerne et al. which involves information-based ideation through Pinterest boards which is the approach that we plan on using in our experiment.

Next week, I plan on finishing and hosting the experiment and starting to pilot the study. This pilot will allow us to fix any bugs in the system that we were not aware of before and see if our results were significant enough on a small scale to a good enough degree. I will also be able to catch up with Overleaf article writing and my literature readings.
